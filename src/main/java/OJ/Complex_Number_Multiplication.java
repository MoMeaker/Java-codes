 *
 * Given two strings representing two complex numbers.

 You need to return a string representing their multiplication. Note i*i = -1 according to the definition.

 Example 1:
 Input: "1+1i", "1+1i"
 Output: "0+2i"
 Explanation: (1 + i) * (1 + i) = 1 + i^2 + 2 * i = 2i, and you need convert it to the form of 0+2i.
 Example 2:
 Input: "1+-1i", "1+-1i"
 Output: "0+-2i"
 Explanation: (1 - i) * (1 - i) = 1 + i2 - 2 * i = -2i, and you need convert it to the form of 0+-2i.
 Note:

 The input strings will not have extra blank.
 The input strings will be given in the form of a+bi, where the integer a and b will both belong to the range of [-100, 100]. And the output should be also in this form.

        return (coefs1[0]*coefs2[0] - coefs1[1]*coefs2[1]) + "+" + (coefs1[0]*coefs2[1] + coefs1[1]*coefs2[0]) + "i";
    }

    }
